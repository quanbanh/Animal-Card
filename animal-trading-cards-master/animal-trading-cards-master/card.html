               Red pandas have a soft, dense woolly undercoat covered by long, coarse guard hairs.
              Long, bushy tails help these arboreal animals maintain balance and protect them from harsh cold and winds. 
              Dense fur completely covers their feet which have five, widely separated toes and semi-retractable claws.
